# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

All formally numbered releases are supported for security issues.

However, if the issue is not able to be replicated on the current
Stable or Beta series it is unlikely to receive attention or fix.
See http://www.squid-cache.org/Versions/ for details of which
versions are the current series.

Code found only in the repository, and for the Development series
is experimental and does not qualify for CVE allocation under
Mitre policy. Reports about security issues in the Development
code are welcome.


## Reporting a Vulnerability

For reporting of security sensitive bugs send an email to the
squid-bugs mailing list
(http://www.squid-cache.org/Support/mailing-lists.html#squid-bugs).
It is a closed list (though anyone can post) and security related
bug reports are treated in confidence until the impact has been
established.

Expect some form of reponse within 24hrs to indicate receipt of
the report. Please feel free to send a reminder query if this is
not recievied.

As a last resort if the squid-bugs contact point appears to be
broken the release maintainer is on the security team. So can be
contacted directly. Response time may be long for this channel.


## Encrypted reports

We are aware some security reporters may be prohibited from
mentioning details of vulnerabilities over unencrypted channels
such as email. GPG keys may be requested from the security team
members via the squid-bugs contact address.

Due to time constraints on team members we would prefer that
regular emails to the mailing list are used, so reports can
receive triage and responses ASAP.
